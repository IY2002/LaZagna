# Autonomous Study Run Log

Started 2026-10-11 ~20:45 ET; runs for 20 hours (until ~2026-10-12 16:45 ET).
Read at every loop iteration. Update "State" and "Next" before ending each iteration.

## Limits
- At most ~30 concurrent SLURM jobs on gts-chao33 (`squeue -u $USER`). No push; local
  commits on `study-fastflow` only.
- Login node: no apptainer. Container work goes through sbatch, using `campaign/binds.sh`.
- Assumptions go in STUDY_ASSUMPTIONS.md (Decision log); results go in STUDY_RESULTS.md.

## Plan
- **A. Characterization (job 13965227 array + summary 13965228):** read
  `characterize_13965228_0.out`. Pick designs: hard blocks contended (DSP or BRAM ≥ ~25%
  used), synthesizes cleanly, size affordable. Split into SEARCH designs (small or medium,
  routed trials affordable) and EVAL designs (wider set for RQ1).
- **B. RQ1, 3D vs 2D:** routed, 5 seeds, every EVAL design, through `phase_2dvs3d.py`
  (DESIGNS_2DVS3D). Report per-design and geomean gains with seed spread.
- **C. RQ2, hard-block placement:** per SEARCH design, a columns study (placement fidelity)
  plus promote (routed top, Pareto, random set, reference, 2D). Also run a structured set of
  named layouts (aligned, offset/staggered, hard blocks all on one layer, DSP and BRAM on
  separate layers, clustered vs spread), so the findings are interpretable rather than just
  "the optimizer found X". Analyze which layout features correlate with CPD/WL.
- **D. RQ3, vertical connectivity:** sweep 3D switch-block connectivity (e.g. 0.1–1.0) on
  the reference layout, routed, 5 seeds, several designs. Report the knee of the
  CPD/WL-vs-links curve.
- **E. Write-up:** STUDY_RESULTS.md with tables, figures (PNG), and insights for each RQ;
  limitations; reproduce commands.

## State (2026-10-12 20:45): FINAL
- The final rerun (13978112, 279 tasks) completed with 0 failures. STUDY_RESULTS.md is written
  from the final tables (docs/study/tables.md, figs in docs/study/figs).
- The loop stalled twice (22:50 to 12:20, and 12:44 to 20:30): scheduled wakeups did not fire.
  The write-up landed after the 16:45 deadline.
- lenet fix applied to yosys.ys after the final run (untested).

## Not done / follow-ups
- Test the lenet fix; run lenet and gemm_layer (long P&R) for RQ1.
- The Optuna searches ran on an earlier synthesis version (the validation re-runs are on the final flow).
